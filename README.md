The Shipment Application, developed in collaboration with Spectrum Dyes & Chemicals Private Limited, represents a sophisticated computerized solution tailored for the Purchase Department. Seamlessly managing both Import and Domestic operations, the application employs a robust technological stack comprising C#, .NET Framework, and Entity Framework Core. It excels in real-time shipment tracking, providing prioritized notifications and a user-friendly dashboard for in-transit shipments. The inclusion of an Automatic Import Custom Duty Calculation Module ensures precise and compliant duty calculations. Additionally, the E-Documents Module enhances document management and regulatory adherence. The system's operational efficiency is further underscored by an Auto-calculate Costing feature, which significantly reduces manual errors in cost estimations.

Financial transparency is achieved through the Shipment Payment Recording Module, offering comprehensive reporting and E-filing capabilities. The Clearing House Agent Billing Module, designed with microservices architecture, streamlines billing transactions. Various reporting modules, including E.T.D, E.T.A, Payments, Pending Due, and Item-wise Costing Reports, leverage the power of SQL Server for seamless data management. The application also facilitates direct data updating via Excel, promoting user flexibility and contributing to efficient data management practices.
